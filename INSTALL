Installation instructions for vblend
------------------------------------

Build tool requirements:
	bash, make, gcc

Library dependencies:
	OpenGL
	readline, ncurses (for building lua, can disable in lua Makefile if desired)

vblend aims to have minimal external dependencies and a simple build process. Consequently,
it currently provides explicit Makefiles for mingw, osx and unix platforms. So, to build
the project under one of those platforms, you can just do:

	:vblend $ make -f Makefile.XXX 
	
Where 'XXX' is one of: 'mingw', 'osx', 'linux'. Then, if that succeeds, you can install 
it in the 'dist' subdir by doing:

	:vblend $ make -f Makefile.XXX' install

Then you can test it by going into the dist subdir and running the 'hello' demo:

	:vblend $ cd dist
	:dist $ ./hello
	
Because of the large amount of redundancy in the makefiles, most of the mingw and
linux ones are generated programatically from the osx ones using lua scripts in the 
'util' subdirectory. 

At some point, autoconf 'configure'-style support may be added, for better porting,
but only in addition to the existing Makefiles, not replacing them.
