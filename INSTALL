Installation instructions for vblend

Vblend aims to have minimal external dependencies and a simple build process. Consequently,
it currently provides explicit Makefiles for mingw, osx and unix platforms. So, to build
the project under one of those platforms, you can just do:

'make -f Makefile.XXX' where 'XXX' is one of: 'mingw', 'osx', 'linux'

Because of the large degree of redundancies in these makefiles, most of the mingw and
linux ones are generated programatically from the osx ones using lua scripts in the 
'util' subdirectory. 

At some point, autoconf 'configure'-style build support may be added, for better porting,
but only in addition to the existing Makefiles, not replacing them.
