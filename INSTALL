Installation instructions for vblend
------------------------------------

Build tool requirements:
	bash, make, gcc

Library dependencies:
	OpenGL

vblend aims to have minimal external dependencies and a simple build process. Consequently,
it currently provides explicit Makefiles for mingw, osx and unix platforms. So, to build
the project under one of those platforms, you can just do:

	:vblend $ make -f Makefile.XXX' where 'XXX' is one of: 'mingw', 'osx', 'linux'

then, if that succeeds, install it in the subdir 'dist' by doing:

	:vblend $ make -f Makefile.XXX' install

Then test it by going into the dist subdir and running the 'hello' demo:

	:vblend $ cd dist
	:dist $ ./hello
	
Because of the large amount of redundancy in the makefiles, most of the mingw and
linux ones are generated programatically from the osx ones using lua scripts in the 
'util' subdirectory. 

At some point, autoconf 'configure'-style support may be added, for better porting,
but only in addition to the existing Makefiles, not replacing them.
