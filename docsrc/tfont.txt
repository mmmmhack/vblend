                                                        *tfont*

tfont is a lua wrapper module for simple text rendering in the graphics window. 
Currently the font module only supports a single fixed 9x15 bitmap font, 
defined in the demo/res/9x15_font.png image file.

The tfont module efficiently renders the character set in this image file using
an opengl texture.

See the 'hello.lua' program in the demo directory for an example of how to
use the tfont module.

LIMITATIONS:

The tfont module currently renders in only a single color, white, as defined by
the color of the pixels in the 9x15_font.png image.


                                                        *functions*
FUNCTIONS

Below are the documented public functions in the tfont module:

|char_width|
|char_height|
|cleanup|
|draw_text_buf|
|init|
|num_rows|
|num_cols|
|set_text_buf|

                                                        *char_width*
char_width()	

Returns width in pixels of a font character.

Params:
	none

Returns:
	width		type: number

                                                        *char_height*
char_height()	

Returns height in pixels of a font character.

Params:
	none

Returns:
	height		type: number

                                                        *cleanup*
cleanup()	

Frees resources associated with the tfont module. This should be called
when done using the font routines.

Params:
	none

Returns:
	none

SeeAlso: |init|

                                                        *draw_text_buf*
draw_text_buf()	

Renders the text in the font text buffer to the screen. The text is specified
with |set_text_buf|.

Params:
	none

Returns:
	nil

SeeAlso: |set_text_buf|

                                                        *init*
init()	

Initializes the tfont module. This function must be called before any of the
others.

Params:
	none

Returns:
	result		type: number, 1 if successfully initialized, else 0

SeeAlso: |cleanup|

Notes:

		- Initialization consists of loading the font image file and creating an 
		opengl texture for it.

		- If the tfont module has already been successfully initialized, this function
		will just return 1 on subsequent calls.

                                                        *num_chars*
num_chars()	

Returns number of characters in a row in the font text buffer.

Params:
	none

Returns:
	num		type: number

                                                        *num_rows*
num_rows()	

Returns number of rows in the font text buffer.

Params:
	none

Returns:
	num		type: number

                                                        *set_text_buf*
set_text_buf()	

Specifies a single row of text to be placed into the font text buffer.
The buffer consists of |num_rows| rows, each having |num_chars| characters. 

After the text is entered into the buffer, |draw_text_buf| must be called to
render it.

Params:
	row			type: number, descrip: row in text buffer, 0-based index with first
	        row at the bottom of the screen.

	col			type: number, descrip: starting column of row in text buffer,
					0-based index with first character at the left of the row.

  text	  type: string, descrip: sequence of characters to be placed in the
	        row.

Returns:
	nil

Notes:
	If the length of the param text exceeds the length of the text buffer row,
	the excess text will be ignored.
