<h1>devlog - wknight - vblend</h1>

<h2>2011-07-02</h2>

<p>
This is a project that aims to provide a vim-like interface to a blender-like 3D graphics editor.
Since freeglut is borked on my macbook, I'll start out with the glfw library to provide the main
window. Will also look through my other projects for C code to render text using bitmaps in
an opengl window - pretty sure the cbots project did that.
</p>

<p>
Read through my devlog for cbots project. Will use the font-rendering code in there, but
will use glfw instead of sdl for window management. glfw looks pretty clean and simple.
</p>

<p>
Got the howdy glfw window app to build and run. glfw is VERY clean and good. It has the 
simplest and most transparent build framework for a Mac OSX OpenGL app that I have ever seen.
It puts the ludicrously complex XCode framework utterly to shame.
</p>

<h2>2011-07-06</h2>

<p>
Up normal time, just a little time to code.
</p>

<p>
I spend most of it getting idutils running on cbots and then finding my project scripts to
remind me how to show osx apps:

<h2>2011-07-17</h2>

<p>
Back from a beautiful vacation to Seattle and the Olympic Peninsula. One more day of vacay left, will
do a little programming today.
</p>

<h2>2011-07-18</h2>

<p>
Created test_font app, adding project to svn.
</p>

<h2>2011-07-20</h2>

<p>
Created font_map app, to investigate performance issues from previous font_lines app,
which really dropped the fps rate down. I note that the plib font code only provides
96 font chars. For the first time, I take note of how many chars are on the standard
keyboard layout: 4 rows:
</p>

<pre>
row 0: 13 keys * 2 = 26
row 1: 13 keys * 2 = 26
row 2: 11 keys * 2 = 22
row 3: 10 keys * 2 = 20
                    ___
                     94
</pre>

<p>
Hmm, where are the other 2? Ah, those 2 spots are blank in the 16x6 output image, good.
</p>

<h2>2011-07-24</h2>

<p>
Progress very slow these days. Thinking about where to head next to achieve the immediate
goal, which is high-performance text rendering in an opengl graphics window. In my continual
drive to understand the fundamentals, combined with tendencies of dilettantism, I re-visited
tinygl. I was able to build and run it on my mac, but the display of the gears app was
a little messed up, some kind of double image. So that started me reading a bit about X-Window
coding. Also been learning more about fonts through reading about fontforge and Tex. Downloaded
some bitmap fonts. Read a little this morning about font rendering using glBitmap() in
the OpenGL redbook.
</p>

<p>
After all this, my plan is to reproduce the simple rendering of the letter 'F' using the glBitmap()
example in the OpenGL book. Then I'm going to try to use/adapt the bitmap data from the glut
GLUT_BITMAP_9_BY_15font to render text.
</p>

<p>
Creating test app 'bitmap_letter'.
</p>

<p>
Done, it works. Next up: use the glut bitmap defs.
</p>

<p>
Working on that, don't have it yet. Here is the def for the letter 'F' in glut Fixed9x15_Character_70[]:
</p>
<pre>
static const GLubyte Fixed9x15_Character_070[] = {  
  9,  0,  
  0,  0,  
  0,  0,  
  0,  0,  
  0, 32,  
  0, 32,  
  0, 32,  
  0, 32,  
  0, 32,  
  0, 60,  
  0, 32,  
  0, 32,  
  0, 32,  
  0,127,  
  0,  0,  
  0,  0,  
  0
};
</pre>

<p>
Need to look at the code I guess... ah, ok, off by 1 at least, first char is bitmap width.
</p>

<p>
Yes! It's working. Finally, I'm thinking I have a simple but fast font-drawing solution for 
OpenGL.
</p>

<h2>2011-07-25</h2>

<p>
Little hacking before work, I found that it's necessary to add the glPixelStore2i() call
in the font code, otherwise, the font chars can be truncated. 
</p>

<p>
Sadly, the fps rate of the new font code seems just as slow as the old one ... very strange.
I'm going to have to do some detailed timings to see where it's slowing down.
</p>

<p>
Next: make an easier way to add apps to Makefile, add a 'console fps' app.
</p>

<h2>2011-07-26</h2>

<p>
Only a little time before work, I need a better test Makefile solution. Should I create
a separate subdir for Mac builds? They have some extra steps.
</p>

<p>
Re-organized the osx Makefile, looked easy enough, then make started doing some weird
implicit build command:
</p>
<pre>
mhackslab:test $ m
"building for mac os Darwin"
gcc   howdy.o howdy.app/Contents/MacOS/howdy   -o howdy
ld: in howdy.app/Contents/MacOS/howdy, can't link with a main executable
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [howdy] Error 1
mhackslab:test $ 
</pre>

<p>
Fixed it, just needed to add an action for the new howdy target, which is the symlink to
the mac osx exe.
</p>

<p>
Ok, reorganized makefiles work. It's about time I started using includes more.
</p>

<p>
Well, time for work already. Next time I'll create the script for adding new targets
to the Makefiles.
</p>

<h2>2011-07-27</h2>

<p>
Ridiculously little time this morning, and my back hurts. Will get started on project
creation script though.
</p>

<p>
Did it, it works.
</p>

<h2>2011-07-28</h2>

<p>
A little time to program before work this morning. Back still hurts a little. It's time
to start cranking out little test apps.
</p>

<p>
Created and ran cl_fps app, something looks wacked with current fps calc:
</p>
<pre>
    3.898484 secs: frame: 9006540, fps:  4060143
    3.898499 secs: frame: 9006600, fps:  4001107
</pre>

<p>
That's 60 frames in 16us, 3.75 frames/us = 3,750,000 fps, hmmm... it's in the ballpark,
but still a sig diff. Perhaps it's because the main-loop timestamp is called after
the call to fps_calc(). Will try calling it before, and will put the 'cur_time' call
in fps_calc() at top of loop, so caller and fps will have as close as possible 'cur_time'
value...
</p>

<p>
Interesting, it significantly drops the frame-rate, probably because sys_float_time()
is called every time now at top of fps_calc(), but that's ok, I'm fine with a more-consistent
fps_calc even with higher overhead. Let's check the calc though:
</p>
<pre>
    7.495249 secs: frame: 13577760, fps:  2681586
    7.495270 secs: frame: 13577820, fps:  2798467
    7.495293 secs: frame: 13577880, fps:  2671478
    7.495314 secs: frame: 13577940, fps:  2916686
    7.495336 secs: frame: 13578000, fps:  2779005
</pre>

<p>
Gah, gotta get to work...
60 frames in 23 usecs = 2.608696 frames/usec = 2,608,696 fps compared to 2,671,478.
A lot closer, cool. I'm thinking that's within the range of function call/return and
instruction exec times.
</p>

<h2>2011-07-30</h2>

<p>
Saturday morning, after a beautiful long night's sleep. My back doesn't hurt anymore.
Today, I want to develop a flexible method for recording, averaging and displaying
time intervals for various chunks of code.
</p>

<p>
Created perf.c. To implement 'perf_mark()' function, I'll need to use a hash library.
I've already used one before, what was it called? And where did I put it? My memory
is like a sieve these days. At some point, I'll need to start working on search projects
and tools.
</p>

<p>
strmap, in ~/swtools/misc. keywords: 'hash library'. Hmm, but that isn't going to
work, because what I need in this case is a str-to-int map. strmap is a str-to-str
map.
</p>

<h2>2011-08-04</h2>

<p>
Finished initial implementation of StrIntMap for perf module, also added checking
of keyboard input to cl_fps, something just crushed the previous performance:
</p>
<pre>
    6.256347 secs: frame: 005700, fps:  668
    6.311799 secs: frame: 005760, fps:  1082
    6.362357 secs: frame: 005820, fps:  1186
    6.437873 secs: frame: 005880, fps:  794
    6.488454 secs: frame: 005940, fps:  1186
    6.578598 secs: frame: 006000, fps:  665
    6.629268 secs: frame: 006060, fps:  1184
</pre>

<p>
Got rid of the key input, not much better:
</p>
<pre>
    3.229764 secs: frame: 003840, fps:  2187
    3.258421 secs: frame: 003900, fps:  2093
    3.279498 secs: frame: 003960, fps:  2846
    3.302289 secs: frame: 004020, fps:  2632
    3.344143 secs: frame: 004080, fps:  1433
</pre>

<p>
Next: identify the cause of the overhead. It's not perf_mark(), which is good.
</p>

<p>
Getting rid of glfwSwapBuffers() makes a big diff:
</p>
<pre>
    4.486396 secs: frame: 015540, fps:  12828
    4.487845 secs: frame: 015600, fps:  41401
    4.489283 secs: frame: 015660, fps:  41721
    4.490756 secs: frame: 015720, fps:  40733
</pre>

<p>
And bypassing glClear() accounts for most of the rest:
</p>
<pre>
    4.239728 secs: frame: 6996720, fps:  2381461
    4.239751 secs: frame: 6996780, fps:  2617545
    4.239774 secs: frame: 6996840, fps:  2604838
    4.239797 secs: frame: 6996900, fps:  2592254
</pre>

<p>
Here is the overhead with just perf_mark(), which is somewhat significant:
</p>
<pre>
    2.043821 secs: frame: 1365840, fps:  908939
    2.043893 secs: frame: 1365900, fps:  833691
    2.043960 secs: frame: 1365960, fps:  895968
    2.044033 secs: frame: 1366020, fps:  822244
</pre>

<p>
Lunch at Butterfly, thinking about how to finish up initial perf implementation,
lots of potential options. At first, thought I would just accumulate all records
and write them out to file at the end. But I prefer to have periodic output and
so now my plan is to just accumulate (sum) and output the average every output
interval, with a default rate of 1Hz, pretty much like the current fps works.
</p>

<h2>2011-08-05</h2>

<p>
Up good and early this morning (3:30 am), I got to sleep at 9:00 am last night,
so it's not too bad. Last night when I tried to work a little more on the existing
perf code, I realized there was a problem in calculating the delta time from the
previous perf mark. This morning, after considering various schemes, I decided to
try to keep each perf time interval separate from any others, requiring an explicit
'perf_mark_beg()' and 'perf_mark_end()' call around every desired interval. This little
extra work is fine because then I can time multiple sections of code that are
not part of the same loop, as is the current case.
</p>

<p>
Got a couple more hours sleep, which was good. Finished initial implementation of
new perf version. Getting report output, but the times are all 0, don't think
I can use float for times, may need to use timevals instead.
</p>

<p>
I need to find my code that did subtraction of timevals, where was it?
Ah, it was in gstep. Thank God for find/grep.
</p>

<h2>2011-08-07</h2>

<p>
Changing perf record timestamp type to timeval.
</p>

<p>
Debugging some time conversion code, timeval t.tv_sec MUST be converted
to (unsigned long) before doing any conversion to usec:
</p>

<pre>
(gdb) p cur_time.tv_sec
$21 = 1312746228
(gdb) p ((long)cur_time.tv_sec) * 1000000L
$18 = -1936087808
(gdb) p ((unsigned long)cur_time.tv_sec) * 1000000L
$19 = 2358879488
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>
I don't quite understand why, as long should hold a max value
of 0x7fffffffffffffffL which is 9223372036854775807,
9,223,372,036,854,775,807 = 9e18
</p>

<p>
Even with the conversion to unsigned long, the multiplication
(at least in gdb) still isn't right. The correct answer should be:
</p>

<pre>
(gdb) p (float)cur_time.tv_sec * 1e6
$23 = 1312746240000000
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>
Well, actually the correct answer should be 1312746228000000. wtf.
Need to go back to remedial computing I guess.
</p>

<p>
Ok, mystery solved, I just wrote a simple c test program and found
that LONG_MAX is only 2^32:
</p>
<pre>
LONG_MAX: 2147483647
ULONG_MAX: 4294967295
ULLONG_MAX: 18446744073709551615
mhackslab:long $ 
</pre>

<p>
Can't believe this whole time I never really realized this.
</p>

<p>
Fixed that, next running in to a problem where the 1us resolution isn't small
enough, I think I need to go to nanosec resolution instead, but there is no
good function for that in stdlib? Strangely, there is only the nanosleep()
time, which sleeps, it doesn't return a current timestamp. However, nanosecond
resolution isn't even guaranteed here, will just stick with usec resolution.
</p>

<p>
No, I want high-resolution! That's the whole point of this perf code, to understand
where the cycles are being consumed. Stackoverflow mentions clock_gettime() as a
stdlib function, but I don't see it in my libc.txt file. Will search /usr/include/
</p>

<p>
Nope, it's not there, so that's out. Searching SO, found: "In effect, it seems not to be implemented for MacOs."
LAME.
</p>

<p>
But also found this:
</p>
<pre>
struct timespec ts;

#ifdef __MACH__ // OS X does not have clock_gettime, use clock_get_time
clock_serv_t cclock;
mach_timespec_t mts;
host_get_clock_service(mach_host_self(), CALENDAR_CLOCK, &amp;cclock);
clock_get_time(cclock, &amp;mts);
mach_port_deallocate(mach_task_self(), cclock);
ts.tv_sec = mts.tv_sec;
ts.tv_nsec = mts.tv_nsec;

#else
clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &amp;ts);
#endif
</pre>

<p>
Added the code, it compiled. Now I need to create a bunch of time functions with timespec
instead of timeval.
</p>

<h2>2011-08-09</h2>

<p>
Up fairly early, have some time to program. Will implement the timespec functions.
</p>

<p>
Did it, looks like it's working:

<p>
Of course, when you consider that processes are continually interrupted by the OS, this large
overhead is to be expected.
</p>

<p>
Hmm, I'm still seeing a lot of inconsistency though when I look at the average times of
glfwSwapBuffers computed with various combinations of 'empty' intervals.
</p>

<p>
I suspect that time interval aliasing might have something to do with it.
</p>

<p>
Ah, wait, I made an important observation: when the graphics window is in the foreground,
the swapbuf time avg is 300us but when in background, it's only 50us. That explains
the variation I'm seeing.
</p>

<p>
Well, only some of the variation. When there are only 2 empty perf calls, the fg swapbuf
time increases inexplicably to 370us, and with only 1 empty perf call, it is around 470us.
That still doesn't make sense to me. Perhaps multiple calls to the perf code result in
some kind of cacheing in the OS or CPU?
</p>

<p>
Well, the bottom line is that I have a workable metric for calculating relative times
for the operations I'm trying to optimize:
</p>

<p>
So glBitmap just takes a long time.
</p>

<p>
Googled glBitmap performance, found this: http://www.opengl.org/resources/features/KilgardTechniques/oglpitfall/ 
</p>

<p>
Then, another search on Stackoverflow, I'm thinking the solution for fast text rendering is a single
texture-binding call and rendering textured quads:
</p>
<blockquote>
The key is that texture binding is the operation you need to minimize. If you
can render all of your text with a single texture, it won't matter how much
text you need to put on the screen. Even if you have to switch textures a
handful of times (different fonts, different font attributes [bold, underline,
etc]) performance should still be good. Text performance might be more critical
for a HUD, but it less important in the GUI.
</blockquote>

<h2>2011-08-13</h2>

<p>
Saturday morn after staying up late partying and watching Aztec Wrestling Women vs. The Mummy.
</p>

<p>
Will start creating apps to draw multiple polys, eventually textured as text, in various
ways to measure performance (client-side vs. server-side rendering)
</p>

<h2>2011-08-14</h2>

<p>
Good night's sleep, up late, can spend most of today programming! Created first of many
apps to measure performance drawing a large number of polys, 'perf_poly_glv', which uses glVertex(). It
draws 2000 polys per frame, current frame rate is:
</p>
<pre>
fps:  472, pps:  946000
fps:  475, pps:  952000
fps:  476, pps:  954000
</pre>

<p>
That performance is extremely good even using the least-efficient method (perhaps because of
cacheing the uniform data), so will update this
to draw textured polys, with a real font bitmap as a better test. To do that, I need to get
an image of a font set, so next app it 'render_font_set'.
</p>

<h2>2011-08-16</h2>

<p>
Been reading up on png format, as that is the image format I will use to store the font set
image. And it's high time I learned at least one image format in greater detail. Also created
a little test app, 'read_png_chnunks', to output the chunks in a png file, this was very easy
to do. Unfortunately, no more time to do anything else this morning.
</p>

<h2>2011-08-22</h2>

<p>
Big long funs break. Only a tiny work done, however, I did complete another test app,
~/proj/test/graphics/png/write_test_image.c. At first I didn't think it was working
because the png file looked too small. Evenutally, I looked through the libpng code
and did a little gdb steppin before realizing that it must have been doing compression
by default. I should have just tried to open the damn thing in an image viewer!! Duh.
</p>

<p>
So the next step is to create a font image from the glut 9x15 char set
</p>

<p>
Created test app 'write_9x15_font_png'.
</p>

<p>
Next, implementing the bits definition, it seems like I must continually forget the format
of the Fixed9x15_Character_XXX arrays... there are 32 bytes for each character... why??
Ah, 16 rows of 2 bytes each, duh...
</p>

<h2>2011-08-23</h2>

<p>
Up at 6:00 am, time for programmings. Last night I finished initial implementation of
defining the image data array for the font char set and output it to a file. It wasn't
right, but a little thought in bed revealed the problem, I was writing out the rows of
each font char sequentially into the array, when they need to be offset so they line
up under each other. Starting on the fix now.
</p>

<p>
Did the change, but still a problem: the end of the img_data array is reached at the
beginning of the 16th bit row of the first character of the final character row.
Not sure why yet.
</p>

<h2>2011-08-24</h2>

<p>
Slept in till 7:20, needed the sleep but now time for programming. Last night in
spare snippets of time, I finished a python program, gen_w9f_map.py, which creates
a text representation of the image data array, to help me debug the problem. Perhaps
that in conjunction with a quick gdb sesh and a cup of coffee will help make the
magic happen.
</p>

<p>
More debugging, I see my python output array is too small, that needs a little more
work.
</p>

<p>
Lunch, quick coding, changed python script to output each pixel row, not each char row.
When finished, will take a another crack at debugging in gdb.
</p>

<h2>2011-08-25</h2>

<p>
Up good and early, should get some good debugging done today. Right now, I'm adding some
docs to my gserver/gclient utility before debugging the write_9x15_font app with it.
</p>

<p>
Well, spent the whole time this morning documenting the vim-gclient lxl debugging setup,
so the actual debugging of the font test program will have to wait for next time.
</p>

<h2>2011-08-26</h2>

<p>
Up fairly late, just a bit of debugging time, but it's Friday! Last night, did a little
more vim-gdb debugging, added some more docs on escaping stuff. This morning, resumed
debugging, still a bug in the python text generator, the dang chXX label in the pixel
rows is still a little off, fixing that. Why is it so damn hard to get correct?
</p>

<p>
Fixed that, but still not right because the byte offsets of the bottom pixel rows
is 5 digits, not 4, so need to add an extra digit to everything. But must do that
later, it's time to go to work.
</p>

<h2>2011-08-27</h2>

<p>
It's Saturday morning, but I'm working today! So only a little time this morning.
I fixed the python program again and am debugging the write_9x15_font_png app
again in vim/gdb. It's on the final character row (pixel row 240, after the
first character (chf0) first pixel row data has been written. Maybe I'll finally find this
bug.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the first pixel row of chf0, it was at 0x3c040, in agreement with
the python output. Then it added num_img_data_row_bytes (0x400), making i == 0x3c440,
as one would expect. But the start of the next pixel row is instead 0x3c400, so there
is a 0x40 byte difference....?
</p>

<p>
Aha, yes, by adding the 0x400 pixel row value to the index variable when it's at the end
of the first pixel row, it drops it down 1 row so that the next row is actually starting
under the second character in the final character row, chf1.
</p>

<p>
Instead, the index var should be set to the initial offset of the chf0 + 
bit_row * num_img_data_row_bytes. I think I've got it.
</p>

<p>
Made the change, it's better, now it overruns on the final character 255:
</p>
<pre>
mhackslab:test $ ./write_9x15_font_png
ch 255: i: 262140, bit_row: 15 bit_col: 01 bit: 7 bit_val: 0
urk!: Unknown error: 0
mhackslab:test $ 
</pre>

<p>
Cool, that's just an off-by-1 error on my overrun check, should be ok.
</p>

<p>
Victory! We have a font set image! The individual characters upside-down, but
that is easily fixed. Damn I'm slow!
</p>

<p>
Back home, a little time before other stuff, will flip them rows so I can start
thinking about the next part.
</p>

<p>
Did that, chars are now drawn right-side up, but still backwards! I have to 
flip that dir too?? Fine.
</p>

<p>
Ok, flipped horizontally, but now it's shifted over too far to the right for some 
reason.
</p>

<p>
I think it's because the original bitmask def had a little padding of the first bitcol
on the left and excess padding on the right, which is now on the left. bleh..
</p>

<p>
This is getting to be a PITA, but ALMOST there...
</p>

<p>
Hmm, looking closely in Gimp, there's some other weird artifact, some stray white 
pixels scattered around in the first 2 character rows... could those be intentional?
Would have to look more closely at the bitmask defs to be sure.
</p>

<p>
So at this point, I could try doing more bit column hacking and flipping or back up,
output the bit cols in existing order, but instead output the char blocks from 
right-to-left and then reverse all the rows...that sounds almost as ugly.
</p>

<p>
Hmm, on further thought, I don't think those artifacts are intentional, there's 
still some bug in the code. Yeah, think I need to keep flipping the 2 bit cols individually,
but keep them in the original sequence.
</p>

<p>
Did it, we're there! Finally, I have a precisely-defined font image that I can use for 
texture-mapping, where I know exactly where every pixel goes.
</p>

<p>
Time for programming is done for today, except to name a new test app, 'draw_tex_font'.
This will draw a font set using texture mapping, in the simplest possible way and 
provide the baseline for more efficient text rendering.
</p>

<h2>2011-08-28</h2>

<p>
Up at 7 am Sunday morning, plenty of free time to program today! Continuing implementation
of 'draw_text_font' app.
</p>

<p>
Later in the day, finished adding code that loads image from png file,
now I'm trying to specify the absolute minimum number of OpenGL calls
for texturing a triangle. Spent a little time reading the OpenGL 2.1
spec. Very dense, but nice reading the ultimate source for OpenGL
behavior. Currently, texturing isn't working (I'm not using texture
objects yet). I think it's because there are some glTexParameter()
calls that are needed, but I don't remember which ones. The OpenGL
red book gives 4 params (GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,
GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER). I think I vaguely remember from a previous
attempt that you have to specify the TEXTURE_MAG/MIN_FILTER params
but not sure. I'll add and see.
</p>

<p>
Aha, confirmed that the GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is the 'minimum' glTexParameter()
that is required.
</p>

<p>
Currently though, the texture is 'messed up', scrambled lower font set chars
at bottom, the top ones are blank.
</p>

<p>
Ok, ruled out texture issues, I did a glDrawPixels() and it's still messed up.
Could it be the missing glPixelStorei() call? Nope.
</p>

<p>
Duh, it was a bug in the image-loading code I grabbed from my cbots project,
I hadn't fully converted from rgb to rgba everywhere.
</p>

<h2>2011-08-29</h2>

<p>
Monday, tired, didn't have any time this morning, maybe I can do a tiny progress
tonight before dinner. Just want to re-define the tex coords to display a
single character instead of the full image, how hard can that be?
</p>

<h2>2011-08-30</h2>

<p>
Too hard for me, I guess. Still not done, only a little time this morning. Will
keep trying...
</p>

<p>
Ok, got it. It now draws the whole font set at 312 fps. Next: create a new
baseline app that draws 'readable' text lines, then start creating optimized
versions.
</p>

<p>
Next app will display 800x600 window with 80x36 text.
</p>

<p>
After work, at home, little coding before breakin bad, getting weird error compiling

<p>
wtf?

<p>
Ah, now I realize the problem with img_h, I did a '#define img_h' in util/img.h. However, that
doesn't explain the error above.
</p>

<p>
Ok, I guess I'm finally realizing that size_t isn't a built-in type in C. Duh.
</p>

<p>
Fixed, test image works! At the incredible fps of 24!
</p>

<h2>2011-08-31</h2>

<p>
Last day of August...sigh. Up at 7, I can do a little this morning. First will add a check
of any existing GL errors ot the baseline app, then also investigate why the window isn't
exactly 800 px wide.
</p>

<p>
Ah, well, that 2nd one was easy, there was a '4' left-over from the 640 that later turned
into an 840! Also making the current base-line app the new template.
</p>

<p>
New baseline with 800x600 window, 80x36 cols is 29 fps (5760 tris). Made it the template, added GL error
check, no errors. Checked in the code. We're ready to optimize.
</p>

<p>
Starting reading again about vertex arrays and vertex buffers.
</p>

<p>
Creating first optimized app tf8036_va (vertex arrays).
</p>

<p>
Read a little about GL arrays, finished create_verts() func, that's all I have time for this morning.
</p>

<p>
More thinkings about next steps, I'll be using glDrawElements(), prob with GL_TRIANGLES to start
and maybe later GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP. The challenge will be to get the verts and tcoords right. I realized
earlier that my first effort wasn't quite righ, it assumed each char row shared verts with the
row below it, but actually in the baseline app, there is a 1 pixel border between, so no sharing
for now.
</p>

<p>
What needs to be done for more efficient tex-mapping of the font is to regenerate the tex image
so that the characters are in 10x16 cells, not 16x16.
</p>

<p>
Wait, it doesn't freakin matter, I can get 10x16 portions from the existing map just by re-defining the 
get_tex_idx() function. Think I'll try changing it to 10x16.
</p>

<p>
Did it, baseline works. Now, back to a more efficient version of the va.
</p>

<p>
Hmm, after all that, now I'm thinking that I won't be able to 'share' the row verts
after all, because the 'bottom' vert of a character in the first row will be associated
with a different tex coord than the same vert for the char in the row below it.
</p>

<p>
So I will need to 'double-define' the verts.
</p>

<p>
Extracted out some common code. Running tf8036_va w/o drawing, we get a null-draw version
with 448 fps.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-01</h2>

<p>
Up late this morning because I was up late last night, very little time for programming but
will try at least to get the tcoord generation done.
</p>

<p>
Finished initial implementation using glDrawElements(), it runs but displays some weird
jaggedy white rows at top, no discernable text. Progress though. And an fps of 248!
</p>

<p>
Now it's just a matter of debugging the data in the verts, tcoords and tris arrays.
</p>

<pre>
(gdb) p _verts[0]
$21 = 0
(gdb) p _verts[1]
$22 = 584
(gdb) p _verts[2]
$23 = 10
(gdb) p _verts[3]
$24 = 584
(gdb) p _verts[4]
$25 = 0
(gdb) p _verts[5]
$26 = 600
(gdb) p _verts[6]
$27 = 10
(gdb) p _verts[7]
$28 = 600
</pre>

<p>
Looks correct to me. Ah, I generated tris wrong, I assumed row-sharing. Changed, still not right.
</p>

<p>
tcoords don't look right:
</p>
<pre>
(gdb) p _tcoords[0]
$1 = 0
(gdb) p _tcoords[1]
$2 = 0.75
(gdb) p _tcoords[2]
$3 = 0.0390625
(gdb) p _tcoords[3]
$4 = 0.75
(gdb) p _tcoords[4]
$5 = 0
(gdb) p _tcoords[5]
$6 = 0.8125
(gdb) p _tcoords[6]
$7 = 0.0390625
(gdb) p _tcoords[7]
$8 = 0.8125
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>
Well, not sure of that until I lookup the expected tcoord for the '0' char...
It's row 3, col 0. Actually, that does look right. So wtf?
</p>

<p>
Hah, I don't think I ever enabled the texture map stuff!!
</p>

<p>
Ok, added tfont_init() call, it's drawing some semi-recognizable rows at the top now!
Almost there I think.
</p>

<p>
Ok, cranking down to 160 tris, they look squished in x dir...
</p>

<p>
Gotta go to work!
</p>

<p>
At work still coding, 2 things wrong: nch inc, 2nd tri index seq
</p>

<p>
Still not it!
</p>

<p>
Lunch at Riverside Cafe, I'm doing explicit glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES) on the
_verts and then the _tcoords to find out what the heck is going on.
</p>

<p>
I did it for the first tri, using previous debug values of the first tri
verts and tcoords. They appear correct, the lower left half of a '0' is drawn. 
The next step is to actually reference the values from the _verts and _tcoords
arrays.
</p>

<p>
Did that, they must be correct.
</p>

<p>
Did glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES) with glArrayElement() and that works too!!??
So the only thing left is incorrect _tris???
</p>

<p>
wtf?
</p>
<pre>
35glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, 1, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, _tris);
(gdb) p _tris[0]
$1 = 0
(gdb) p _tris[1]
$2 = 1
(gdb) p _tris[2]
$3 = 2
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>
fuck:
</p>
<pre>
voidglDrawElements(GLenummode, GLsizei count, GLenum type, 
const GLvoid *indices); 
Defines a sequence of geometric primitives using count number of ele- 
ments, whose indices are stored in the array indices.
</pre>

<p>
I was assuming tri count, not vert count!
</p>

<p>
That's it. Jesus.
</p>

<p>
190 fps.
</p>

<p>
When I move the window around, it flickers, fps jumps to 362 and stays there on next
run. Whatever, must be os/driver cacheing or something.
</p>

<p>
Next up: server-side.
</p>

<p>
Tonight, probably just sporadic programming. Here are some items to address:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Re-work write_9x15_font_png to output 0 alpha for empty parts of char bitmaps
<li>Start using texture objects
<li>Find out why the null app is only 448 fps (should be higher)
</ul>

<p>
Added alpha to 9x15 font bg, it works.
</p>

<p>
Need to enable transparency now in the test app.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-02</h2>

<p>
Friday, yeah. Up pretty early, reading the OpenGL book chapter on blending. Before,
I never really understood what the hell I was doing beyond learning you had to
enable blending and pick a blend function with some random blend factors until it
it worked. Now I will try to understand.
</p>

<pre>
Result red pixel = R<sub>s</sub>S<sub>r</sub> + R<sub>d</sub>D<sub>r</sub>
R<sub>s</sub>: Source red pixel
R<sub>d</sub>: Dest red pixel

S<sub>r</sub>: Source blending factor
D<sub>r</sub>: Dest blending factor
</pre>

<p>
Here is what I want:
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Source red pixel</th><th>Source alpha</th><th>Dest red pixel</th><th>Result red pixel</th></tr>
<tr><td>0 <td>0           </td><td>0.5           </td><td>0.5             </td></tr>
<tr><td>1 <td>1           </td><td>0.5           </td><td>1               </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
In other words, if the src alpha (A<sub>s</sub>) is 1, the result should be the source pixel. If the src alpha
is 0, the result should be the dest pixel.
</p>

<p>
So what values of S<sub>r</sub> and D<sub>r</sub> will give me that?
</p>

<p>
Well, one solution seems to be S<sub>r</sub> = A<sub>s</sub>, D<sub>r</sub> = 1 - A<sub>s</sub>:
</p>
<pre>
0 * 0 + 1 * 0.5 = 0.5
1 * 1 + 0 * 0.5 = 1
</pre>

<p>
So I did this, as before, and it works:
</p>
<pre>
glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
glEnable(GL_BLEND);
</pre>

<p>
But now I understand a little better how and why. for tf8036_va, fps this morning on my macbook
is 355.
</p>

<p>
Friday afternoon, done with work! What's next? Texture objects and new tfont functions
for drawing using glDrawElements().
</p>

<p>
Another consideration: how is selective coloring of text to be done? Changing all the
text color uniformly could be done by changing the underlying texture image data, but
to selective modify individual characters seems to require something like either 
multi-texturing or some kind of overlaid image and a blending function. I'll worry about 
that later, first need to start defining the new tfont functions. And should actually
start out by defining a new tf8036 app to test it, such as tf8036_xt (external texture).
</p>

<p>
Created app and 2 new tfont funcs: tfont_set_text_buf() and tfont_draw_text_buf().
</p>

<p>
Last night I thought a little about the vim commands for 3D graphical movement and
which keys to use for the z axis. At that time, I was going to go with '-' and '='
because that's what I use for 'pg-up' and 'pg-down' and I couldn't visualize what
other home row keys might be applicable that were comparable to h-l and j-k. But
now, looking at the keys, the choice is obvious: i-o (in-out). The only potential
conflict is with the existing use of 'i' to go into insert mode (as well as 'o'),
but I'm not sure yet if such a parallel exists for 3D graphical editing. The
closest thing that I can think of in that case is 'tab' which in Blender toggles
between object and edit mode, and that could simply be retained instead. There
isn't really a close corollary in 3D graphical editing for inputting a sequence of 
characters, I think.
</p>

<p>
Finished initial implementation of tfont text buf code and tf8036_xt. It was 
pretty easy because I just copied stuff from tf8036_va. It crashes on first
run though.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-03</h2>
<p>
Saturday morning, up early, not much sleep. And I'm working half-day today,
so we'll see what gets done. Right now, debugging the new tfont routines.
</p>

<p>
It crashes on the initial 'blank space' array, so that rules out the tfont_set_text_buf()
function. Here is the stack crash at the crash:
</p>
<pre>
0x1437c14a in gleRunVertexSubmitImmediate ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0x1437c14a in gleRunVertexSubmitImmediate ()
#1  0x1437954a in gleLLVMArrayFunc ()
#2  0x1437954a in gleLLVMArrayFunc ()
#3  0x143794d7 in gleSetVertexArrayFunc ()
#4  0x1435479a in gleDrawArraysOrElements_ExecCore ()
#5  0x143556f8 in gleDrawArraysOrElements_IMM_Exec ()
#6  0x955c6aa4 in glDrawElements ()

#8  0x000027fb in main (argc=1, argv=0xbffff7b0) at tf8036_xt.c:38
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>
No source code to debug, that sucks. Ah, first thing to try is to reduce
the number of tris drawn in glDrawElements().
</p>

<p>
Hmm, still crashing drawing just one tri.
</p>

<p>
Probably some bounds error, maybe time for valgrind? First maybe I'll just add
my own bounds checks.
</p>

<p>
Fixed, I had just forgotten to add the glVertextPointer() and glTexCoordPointer()
calls before glDrawElements() in tfont.c. Duh.
</p>

<p>
Next: start on some editing functions.
</p>

<p>
New app: tf_edit. First new thing: add a cursor overlay. I'll do it like vim, which
is a simple semi-transparent blinking block cursor.
</p>

<p>
Home after a long day's work, along with bike repair that made it a lot more than 
half-day. While biking to work I worked out some more plans. First up: get the
cursor working and then define an array of line buffers to hold text that
gets selectively written to the screen buffer depending on current row and col
scroll position.
</p>

<p>
Then soon, to implement most of the vim functionality, I think I'll add
a Lua interpreter to handle most of the keyboard input. It's something I've
already done before on other projects. With this C-based project it should
be even easier (one C++/swig project bogged things down with too much complexity,
so I'll probably write my own interface functions).
</p>

<h2>2011-09-04</h2>

<p>
Sunday morning, up early with sufficient sleep. Time to make the cursor happen.
</p>

<p>
Added display of fps in win title.
Added dependency generation to makefiles.
</p>

<p>
Created edit lib.
</p>

<p>
Cursor draws without texture drawing, but not with. Probably need to save/restore
some draw state in the tex drawing calls.
</p>

<p>
Cursor drawing is working. It really is time to start using texture objects.
</p>

<p>
Added the texture object, not really seeing the advantages of it yet thought.
Anyhow, continuing with adding cursor movement. But should I add the lua interface
to do that first? Why not.
</p>

<p>
Cracking open the lua book, doing a quick re-read. Creating first test prog,
lua_sinterp (simple interpreter).
</p>

<h2>2011-09-05</h2>

<p>
Spent most of the morning reading the Lua book. Now, I'm ready to do the first lua
program, which will be a simple one that defines a single lua function, 'keydown()',
which will be the key input handler. I'll call the function from C code using
lua_pcall(), along the lines of the sample code in 25.3. Unfortunately, right now,
I have to get ready and go to work.
</p>

<p>
Lunch, only time for a very little programming. I want to start the next progrm
that both displays graphics and runs a lua interpreter. Well, just modify the 
tf_edit program to do that.
</p>

<p>
Grr, first must fix a bug in the makesfiles, the lua_sinterp is stepping
on the includes var, messing up subsequent ones.
</p>

<p>
I think I need to change the Makefile strategy to must call make on
each individual makefile.
</p>

<p>
I will be late for work, but I did it.
</p>

<p>
Home late, just a little time before dinner. Will try to add something to
the tf_edit program.
</p>

<p>
Ah, a new problem: new makefile scheme doesn't rebuild on src file changes.
By moving the build commands for each app into a separate makefile, the
dependency chain is broken in the main makefile. Easiest fix is to just
call all the proj makefiles unconditionally.
</p>

<p>
Fixed by adding $(targets) to phony.
</p>

<p>
key input callback is working. Time for lua!
</p>

<h2>2011-09-06</h2>

<p>
Up at 7, getting to it. Lua.
</p>

<p>
Did luaL_dofile() and lua_pcall(), it works! Lua rocks. Simplicity rocks.
</p>

<p>
Next: make lua move the cursor.
</p>

<p>
Registering C functions in lua.
</p>

<p>
Added l_edit_set_cursor(), it freakin works! We are ready to rock and roll.
</p>

<p>
I've got a program with lua-controlled cursor movement! It's just too easy!
</p>

<p>
After work. Next up: key autorepeat. Will need to add a timer event. The easiest
is to drive it from the main loop.
</p>

<p>
Adding a tick function to handle key autorepeat.
</p>

<p>
I don't see a lua function for getting millisecond time, so will write a
wrapper func.
</p>

<p>
Autorepeat is working! Sweetness.
</p>

<p>
TODO: figure out how to detect undeclared lua vars (biting me already)
</p>

<h2>2011-09-07</h2>

<p>
Up pretty early (5:30 am) and got enough sleep. I have some precious time for
coding, will get to it. What to do next? The command-line I think.
</p>

<p>
So, first thing, I need a way to get key codes defined in lua. Thought a
little about this yesterday, will write a lua script to generate the
definitions. Could either be in lua or C, why not just be in lua.
</p>

<p>
While I'm at it, might as well consider key-mapping, so I also need
to consider key-sequence mappings. Hmm, don't want to bite off too much
at first though. Will just keep it in mind for now. Think it's time
to start looking at vim source code however.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the vim source code, I see that it references literal 'c'
values. If it's good enough for vim, it's good enough for me.
</p>

<p>
We have the beginnings of a command-line. Next: apply 'shift' to produced
shifted key values (currently 'shift-;' produces only ';' instead of ':')
</p>

<h2>2011-09-08</h2>

<p>
Great night's sleep but only a little time left for programming. Possible
turbulence ahead. Can I get the 'shift' op to at least work?
</p>

<p>
Still need those key code defs from glfw.h.
</p>

<p>
At Modwest, but not working yet. Caught the bus, got in early, now
time for a little more vblend coding on the couch upstairs. I'm
implementing the 'shifted_keycode' table. Not sure if it's the right
way to do it, but it will do what I need for now.
</p>

<p>
After work, debugging glfw keycode mappings:
</p>
<pre>
  k: [A], v: [A], ch: [A]
k!=ch: type(k): string, type(ch): string
k!=ch: #(k): 1, #(ch): 2
ch[1]: [A], ch[2]: []
</pre>

<p>
Finally zeroing in on it.  This is the culprit conversion:
</p>
<pre>
ch = string.char(k,1)
</pre>

<p>
Reading the freakin docs on string.char() again...
</p>
<blockquote>
### `string.char (***)`

Receives zero or more integers. Returns a string with length equal to the
number of arguments, in which each character has the internal numerical code
equal to its corresponding argument.

Note that numerical codes are not necessarily portable across platforms.
</blockquote>

<p>
Well, amazing what reading the freakin docs can do.
</p>

<p>
Ok, key code conversion is finally working.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-09</h2>

<p>
Up good and early, got enough sleep, and it's Friday!! First thing: finish the
keycodes.lua table, then get started on the command-line.
</p>

<p>
Now that I've added key code to ascii code translation, the naming of the
char-pressed and char-input functions becomes more clear.
</p>

<p>
We've got text display on the command-line!
</p>

<p>
Checking in code, wtf happened to my ssh key for my mmmmhack acct, it's not
being recognized. I'm guessing the mmmmhack shell acct is busted. Will
find out soon enough.
</p>

<p>
On the bus to work, nice to have the extra programming time. Next: implement
bs and ret for cmd-line.
</p>

<p>
bs is working.
</p>

<p>
Friday after work, on the bus! Will read more about how to do inter-module
refs in the lua book at some point, but I think right now I can just specify
the global module name. I'd really like to check in the existing code first
though, but my freakin mmmmhack acct on modwest has a really weird mounting
problem that not even jneff could fix. Maybe that means it's finally time to
go git.
</p>

<p>
Built and installed version 1.7.5.2 from source no probs. Reading OReilly
git book.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-10</h2>

<p>
Saturday, up very early, but not enough sleep and too much beer last night.
But will forge on.  Copied existing project dir over to a new one where I'll
create a git repository.
</p>

<p>
Created the repository and did the initial commits. Pretty straightforward.
So now, will continue work on the project and do more git stuff as it comes
up.
</p>

<p>
Later, after a lot more sleep, which is good, taking another a look at the
code and thinking how to reorganize to deal with the different modes.
For now, I'm thinking to define 3 different modules, 'cmd_mode', 'normal_mode', 'insert_mode'.
So this will require my first git rename, which I'm sure is very simple, but
will read a little more of the git book for that.
</p>

<p>
Before the rename, did my second git commit after learning to do 'git commit -a'
('git commit' by itself didn't do anything). Next, I want to learn how to do
the equivalent of 'svn propedit svn:ignore'.
</p>

<p>
Seems pretty simple, just edit .gitignore.
</p>

<p>
Did rename, easy. The simple git stuff is just like subversion. I can't believe
it took me so long to start using it.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-11</h2>

<p>
Good night's sleep, no beer last night, I'm good to go. Continuing with modularization
and cmd-line impl.
</p>

<p>
Finished init cmd-line input, adding normal mode op count.
</p>

<p>
In the process of implementing line movement, I'm adding a new 'line_buf' module.
</p>

<p>
It will soon be time to start outputting stack trace on error.
</p>

<p>
line movement with count is working!
</p>

<p>
Next: insert mode. This requires scroll pos data, which I will initially put in the 'win' module.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-12</h2>

<p>
Up with little time, but got append working. Next: insert. It works too.
</p>

<p>
Next: line scrolling.
</p>

<p>
After work. Will implement '$' before line scrolling, for easy move-to-end-of-line.
Done. Will also add 'q' cmd now that ESC no longer works to exit the app.
</p>

<p>
quit cmd works.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-13</h2>

<p>
Up early, time to code. Get the scrolling working.
</p>

<p>
I thought it would be a fairly simple thing to get started on, but I see that I need
to think more deeply about the problem. There are a few pieces involved:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the screen cursor
<li>an array of text lines, collectively the text buffer
<li>a window that is a subset of the screen area
</ul>

<p>
These pieces must somehow be combined to map a subset of the text lines into
a 'view' on the screen.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I had the notion of using the cursor module to manage scrolling, but
currently the cursor position only refers to the location on the screen. There
needs to be some representation of cursor position in the line buffers as well.
I'll probably think about this on a bike ride in to work.
</p>

<p>
After work, taking a break from biking home to work a little more to get my
mind in the groove. This morning, I decided I needed something like 'scr_to_buf()'
and 'buf_to_scr()' to determine scroll offsets on cursor move. Also, I'll
change existing cursor.get_pos() function to cursor.get_scr_pos(), and also add
cursor.get_buf_pos(). The cursor must somehow be associated with a row,col position
in the buffer, not just with the screen. The movement actions will cause
the cursor.set_buf_pos() to be called, which in turn will update the screen pos.
</p>

<p>
A little more biking, a little more thought. I will create the buffer module
with functions that operate on buf tables.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-14</h2>

<p>
Up early, get coding. Must finish buffer code and get the program working again.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-15</h2>

<p>
Another day, up early, must finish buffer code and get the program working again.
</p>

<p>
Ok, finished the initial implemention of the buffer code, let the debugging begin!
</p>

<p>
Got an initial display, then error in util.isdigit(). I'm tempted to add stack trace
output in the error handler.
</p>

<p>
On the bus to work, will read a little about lua debug, maybe implement stack trace if
time.
</p>

<p>
Added call to debug.traceback() after lua pcall() in tf_edit.c, but it didn't
print anything on error.
</p>

<p>
After work on the bus, read a little more of the lua book and realized that I need
to use xpcall() instead with debug.traceback as the error function.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-16</h2>

<p>
Friday, Hallelujah. Up real early, gonna figure out that debug deal. Amazingly, last
night, I couldn't find any examples of lua_pcall() that use an error handler on
Google. Will try for a bit to just figure it out.
</p>

<p>
Tried one more thing, then started to debug the C code in gdb, realized I was on
a Mac, time to push this baby via git to Linux.
</p>

<p>
On my linux box, looks like the git clone worked. All I did was:
</p>
<pre>
  git clone ssh://williamknight@mhackslab/~/proj/git/vblend
</pre>

<p>
First though, I needed to add 'git-upload-pack' to my path on my mac. So now, probably
just some fix-ups to get the project to build in linux, hopefully not too much work.
</p>

<p>
First though, I will just commit this devlog text and make sure I can pull it back from
my mac.
</p>

<p>
Ok, I did it. Just did a pull from my mac specifying the path via ssh to my linux box.
Easy. I'll leave this comment on mac side while continuing edits on linux side just
for some merging practice.
</p>

<p>
Home, Friday! Yeah! A little progress hopefully before relaxing tonight. Will write
a stub lua program to test lua_pcall(), which I realized that I can debug on the mac
with gdb.
</p>

<p>
Got the test app running. The deal now is that the error function is being called
regardless of whether an error occurs and there is no error message.  Ah, it's
not calling the freakin test func.
</p>

<p>
Sweet, got the traceback working. Just had to push the error handler func before
the pcall() func and specify a stack pos arg of '1' for the handler arg.
</p>

<p>
So now here is the stack trace of the current keydown error:
</p>
<pre>
mhackslab:test $ r
---l_traceback

</pre>

<h2>2011-09-17</h2>

<p>
Up early Saturday morn, didn't drink too much beer, let's go.
</p>

<p>
I fixed the proximate problem (I had added 'local' declarations to all function local vars,
but did it mindlessely and some were not in the right scope). Stack traces helps
the fixes, but a real debugger would be nice. Will have to create it at some point.
</p>

<p>
Cursor movement is working again!
</p>

<p>
Command mode is working again!
</p>

<h2>2011-09-18</h2>

<p>
Sunday afternoon, after staying up ridiculously late. Working on insert code.
</p>

<p>
Stack trace still not working right, debugging again in gdb:
</p>
<pre>
mhackslab:test $ r
_debug flag set

lua_draw(): No such file or directory
mhackslab:test $ 
</pre>

</p>
. Rebuilt lua lib with -O0 -g.

<p>
Tracing in to the lua code, I can't see how the error handler is called. Next, 
will trace in for a case where the error handler _is_ called to see how.

<p>
Next: I need to start creating some stack dump/inspection functions.
</p>

<p>
Added the one from the lua book, here is the problem:
</p>
<pre>
--- BEG dump_lua_stack
top: 1205
failed calling lua draw handler: error in error handling
lua_draw(): No such file or directory
mhackslab:test $ 
</pre>

<p>
I'm think lack of recursion checks and stack overflow are the cause of this problem. Will
find out soon.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-19</h2>

<p>
Monday, a little time before I have to go. Will add lua stack space checks now.
</p>

<p>
Added printout of lua stack top in all functions that call lua, looks like something 
is not getting popped:
</p>
<pre>
...
END draw()
BEG tick()
top: 17
top: 18
END tick()
BEG draw()
top: 18
top: 19
END draw()
BEG tick()
top: 19
top: 20
END tick()
BEG draw()
top: 20
top: 21
Error: lua checkstack: top: 21
</pre>

<p>
So my first thought is that I need to pop the error handler function that I've been pushing.
</p>

<p>
That fixes the stack overflow problem, now I can see the args on the stack at the failed
error-handler call:
</p>
<pre>
mhackslab:test $ r
_debug flag set
--- BEG lu_dump_stack
top: 3
{t: [table], t: [function], t: [function], }
--- END dump_lua_stack
failed calling lua draw handler: error in error handling
lua_draw(): No such file or directory
mhackslab:test $ 
</pre>

<p>
That's all for this morning.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-20</h2>

<p>
Tuesday morn, not a whole lot of time. Will try to make some progress on this error handler
problem.
</p>

<p>
By calling lu_dump_stack(), I've determined that the stack starts out empty and then goes
to 1 with a table pushed, after the first call to luaL_register(L, "tflua", _tflua_lib):
</p>
<pre>
AFT lua_openlibs()
--- BEG lu_dump_stack
top: 0
{}
--- END lu_dump_stack
AFT luaL_register()
--- BEG lu_dump_stack
top: 1
{t: [table], }
--- END lu_dump_stack
</pre>

<p>
I think the problem here may be that I'm using the luaL_register() incorrectly somehow.
It might be intended to be used only in conjunction with a shared library that is
loaded by the require statement in lua code, whereas currently I'm keeping the code
in the main application...? Not sure if this is the problem, will need to think about
it.
</p>

<p>
Next, I will make a test app with a shared lib file to register in the way described
in the PIL book and check the state of the stack there.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-21</h2>

<p>
Tuesday morning, I know what to do.
</p>

<p>
Finished coding, trying to create shared lib on mac, it can't make .so, must make
.dylib, but how to tell lua to load it? 
SO answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5900816/osx-loading-dylib-lua-module
</p>

<p>
Even simpler, I can just specify a '-o tlr.so'. The trick was to specify the '-dynamic'
flag with gcc:
</p>
<pre>
tlr.so: tlr.o
$(CC) -dynamiclib -o tlr.so $&lt; $(lua_libs)
</pre>

<p>
Well, doesn't exactly work, after building, when I do "require('tlr')" in lua, it
doesn't cause an error but it defines a function, not a table. And then when I call
the function it segfaults. Freakin macs.
</p>

<p>
google.
</p>

<p>
After downloading some code from lhf and more compiling, I noticed a compiler warning
compiling tlr.c and realized I was calling lua_register() instead of luaL_register()!
</p>

<p>
It's working now.
</p>

<p>
After work, maybe I can get a little work started on the move of the existing 
registered lua funcs in tf_edit.c over to a separate C shared lib module.
</p>

<p>
Ok, finally have a function on the stack, hopefully it is the traceback func:
</p>
<pre>
mhackslab:test $ r
AFT lua_newstate()
top: 0
{}
AFT lua_openlibs()
top: 0
{}
AFT lua_register()
top: 0
{}
AFT lua_dofile()
top: 0
{}
lua_draw(): BEF push traceback
top: 0
{}
lua_draw(): AFT pcall
top: 1
{t: [function], }
rc: 0
mhackslab:test $ 
</pre>

<p>
Yes! Finally got the damn traceback during the original error:
</p>
<pre>
--- BEG tf_traceback
err: ./lua/buffer.lua:106: attempt to get length of local 'ln' (a nil value)
[./lua/util.lua]:29
2C function
[./lua/buffer.lua]:106
[lua/tf_edit.lua]:184
lua_pcall returned: 0
mhackslab:test $ 
</pre>

<p>
I can see where the error is in the lua code, but now instead of continuing with
printf-style debugging, I am seriously considering biting the bullet and seeing
if I can implement a lua debugger with breakpoints and all that!
</p>

<p>
Checking out remdebug, I see that I already downloaded it once!
</p>

<h2>2011-09-22</h2>

<p>
Thursday, up at the usual time, some time for programming. I read a chunk of the debug
library chapter in PIL and think I have an idea on how to implement a simple
debugger. Previously, I thought I would have to do it in C, but now I'm thinking
I should be able to do a lot of it in lua, which will make the parsing much easier.
</p>

<p>
Wow, think I might actually have the freakin debugger working already!
</p>
<pre>

</pre>

<p>
Nice progress this morning.
</p>

<p>
After work, still at work! I think I will do a little more coding, and maybe push the dang git
repos to my modwest account! In fact, I should probabl do that first.
</p>

<p>
Later, at Wardens. A little more work before dancing. I did the git push, it was pretty
easy. Here is all that was required on the local end:
</p>
<pre>
 2237  git remote add origin mmmmhack@shell.modwest.com:git/vblend
 2238  git push origin master
</pre>

<p>
On the remote end, it was a little tricker. I did:
</p>
<pre>
/git/vblend $ git --bare init
/git/vblend $ cd ../..
/ $ mkdir -p proj/vblend
/ $ cd proj/vblend
/proj/vblend $ git remote add origin /git/vblend
/proj/vblend $ ???
</pre>

<p>
Don't remember that last part, will look it up later.
</p>

<p>
So biking in, I figured I can just do nearly all the debugger code in lua.
Starting on a new lua module, test/lua/tf_debug.lua, and function debug_console().
</p>

<h2>2011-09-23</h2>

<p>
Sweet Friday, up good and early. Finished conversion of debugger code from C to lua,
it works!
</p>

<p>
Ok, way late for work, but printing of variable values in debugger is starting to happen.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-24</h2>

<p>
Saturday, had fun last night but can still code this morning. Continuing with routines to
print variable values in the debugger.
</p>

<p>
I added code to determine the stack level of the debug target function at breakpoint,
independent of how many levels of debug functions there are. It took me more work than
I thought.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-25</h2>

<p>
Sunday morning, back at it. Working on the recursive printing of expressions.
</p>

<p>
It's working.
</p>

<p>
The debugger helped me find the buffer-drawing bug. The bug is that all lines in a window needed
to be drawn on vscroll, but the code assumed that the array of lines in the buffer was at
least the size of the number of lines in the window, which is not true and caused an array bounds error:
</p>
<pre>
-- redraw all lines in window if scrolled
if b.scrolled then
beg_row = b.scroll_pos[1]
end_row = math.max(#b.lines - 1, beg_row + b.win_size[1] - 1)
end
for i = beg_row, end_row do
=&gt;local ln = b.lines[i]
local end_col = math.min(#ln, beg_col + b.win_size[0])
-- for now: pad out the rest of the line to the end of the buffer window. later, maybe optimize?
local pad = b.win_size[0] - (end_col - beg_col)
local s = string.sub(ln, beg_col, end_col) .. string.rep(" ", pad)
tflua.set_screen_buf(scr_row, scr_col, s)
scr_row = scr_row + 1
end
</pre>

<p>
(end_row is 34, b.lines = {[0] = "012345..."})
</p>

<p>
Probably the fix for this is to test for end of buffer lines and draw blank lines past the end.
In any case, the built-in debugger is a success!
</p>

<p>
Now I've got plenty of buffer-scrolling logic to work out. Since my head is fuzzy and I'm
lazy, I will try to create a bunch of unit tests to get it worked out.
</p>

<p>
Starting on unit tests for buffer, first up, will add an intermediate step of creating
the display buffer, which can then be checked by unit tests, before copy to actual
screen buffer.
</p>

<p>
Started writing unit tests, they are so easy to do in lua. But now I'm wanting to use the
debugger for the unit tests!
</p>

<p>
Damn, it's pretty easy to do, just needed a couple of requires and a call to 'debug_console()'
in the main() function of the unit test. But need to tweak checking of the src lines
to break at in check_breakpoints().
</p>

<p>
Did that, but still need more tweaks for detecting correct target function level, it's apparently
different from case where debugger runs in tf_edit.
</p>

<p>
Debugging the debugger:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; c
continuing program execution
breakpoint hit!

<p>
Target is 2 levels above debug_console level of 2, so target abs level 
is 2+2 = 4, which is correct, but debug_console level is wrong.
</p>

<p>
Fixed that, but stack level still off by one.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-26</h2>

<p>
Must get the debugger working again. Here's the current problem: the current
stack bottom is 12, it's dumping from stack level 8.
</p>

<p>
Part of the problem is that I keep getting fooled by the stack levels, as reported by
traceback(), which are all incremented by 1 relative to the caller, in this case,
eval_local_var_expr().
</p>

<p>
Here is the traceback output in eval_local_var_expr():
</p>
<pre>
eval_local_var_expr(): looking for local var at stack level 7
 1 [../tf_debug.lua]:63 (traceback)
 2 [../tf_debug.lua]:146 (eval_local_var_expr)

 9C function
10 [test_buffer.lua]:74 (main)
11 [test_buffer.lua]:84 (nil)
12C function
</pre>

<p>
Executing eval_local_var_expr(), it would be:
</p>
<pre>
eval_local_var_expr(): looking for local var at stack level 7
 1 [../tf_debug.lua]:146 (eval_local_var_expr)
 2 [../tf_debug.lua]:190 (print_local_var_expr)

 9 [test_buffer.lua]:74 (main)
10 [test_buffer.lua]:84 (nil)
11 12C function
</pre>

<p>
So I think I will change the return values of getinfo_bottom() and getinfo_level(). Did it,
and the debugger is working again. And helping me find bugs.
</p>

<p>
First 2 unit tests are passing.
</p>

<p>
After, more unit tests!
</p>

<p>
Added new unit test to set content of new line, now I need to think of the appropriate 
function name to update display lines, separate from draw(). Hmmm, maybe I'll call
it 'update_display_lines()'... :)
</p>

<p>
Added it, and another unit test which passes, but no display! More debugging,
need to add bracket indexing to debug print command, it's not working correctly.
</p>

<p>
Fixed.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-27</h2>

<p>
Up in the middle of the night, back to coding. The debugger is helping me find the bugs.
</p>

<p>
More debugger fun. While debugging a line in the middle of a loop, I found that
the 'q' command in the debugger didn't work. At first I tried to understand why
the code wasn't returning to the calling C code to detect the exit state and quit
and then I finally realized that it isn't going to return to the caller C code
until the debugged lua code returns, which won't happen until I turn off the debug 
hook in the 'q' handler. Duh.
</p>

<p>
Fixed.
</p>

<p>
Fixed a bug in the cmd_mode code, but cursor still not working. Need to create
lots more unit tests. I'm going to start the next one and go to bed.
</p>

<p>
Got the buffer incCursor() test in place, but need more code re-org, because it's
trying to call the actual tflua.set_cursor function. Need a mock or something.
But now, back to bed!
</p>

<p>
Up late, gotta go to work, will only do a tiny bit more work, the required stub
function is trivial.
</p>

<p>
Lunch, a tinuy bit of proggin time, finished the setScroll unit test, next:
incCursor one.
</p>

<p>
Got it working (hscroll at right insert, but cursor display still not right,
so next: cursor pos unit tests)
</p>

<h2>2011-09-28</h2>

<p>
Up early today, but spent most of it researching x3d. I don't think it's gonna
happen. Will start looking in to WebGL tomorrow. In the mean time, will do
a few more unit tests before work.
</p>

<p>
buffer tests are passing, next to fix the current cursor-pos bug in insert_mode,
I need to create insert unit tests.
</p>

<p>
First insert_mode unit test is running (but failing).
</p>

<p>
Adding buffer.dump() method, will call it in insert_mode() for comparison of state
agains unit tests.
</p>

<p>
Ok, that helps. I think the current problem is that b.cursor pos is relative to
buffer pos and in set_cursor() it gets converted to window pos, so a cursor pos
of 79 + scroll pos of 1 translates to a cursor window pos of 80, I think.
</p>

<p>
Confirmed, and that will be off-screen. pos needs to be 79.
</p>
<pre>
buffer.set_cursor(): calling tflua.set_cursor(0, 78)
buffer.set_cursor(): calling tflua.set_cursor(0, 79)
buffer.set_cursor(): calling tflua.set_cursor(0, 80)
</pre>

<p>
On the drive in to work, I thought for a bit about stuff and came to the conclusion
that the needed fix is to just subtract the scroll_pos from the cursor_pos to
get the correct cursor position in the window. I'll try it. 
</p>

<p>
Did this, although the situation is a little more complex than I realized because
the scroll position is adjusted _in_ the set_cursr() function to ensure the
cursor position is in the window.
</p>

<p>
Kool, that fixed it!
</p>

<p>
Still lots of other cursor probs though, first one is moving to the beginning of the row,
_after_ doing an insert w/ scroll (it's fine in normal mode before doing insert).  But that's 
all for now.
</p>

<h2>2011-09-30</h2>
<p>
It's Friday! The last couple of days I started making a separate lua app that
does simple graphics using a C module for glfw code. The program is run by
the lua interpreter. I'm thinking of extending this approach by creating 
C modules for both opengl and glfw. Think I'll call the project either 'glua'
(which is prabably already taken) or possibly 'gluah'. Hmm, there is already
glllua, and created by Waldemar Celes to boot. But his link is down.
Maybe gluyah.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-01</h2>

<p>
Saturday morning, up early, little too much beer but I can still program. 'gluyah'
is a stupid name. Just start making the wrappers.
</p>

<p>
pws. todo: write or get a pretty-printer to reformat indenting to 4 spaces.
add return val.
camera, image recog, security, bones, 3d transform from python 3d edit app.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-02</h2>

<p>
uh huh.
</p>
<p>
Sunday morning, continuing work on lua code to generate C wrapper code for glfw.
Code for wrapping most of the functions is working, but to test it I also need
to generate code for the GLFW_XXX constants.
</p>

<p>
Started doing that, going well, but now I need an efficient way to strip out
C block comments. With lua's nice balanced-delimiter matching capabilities,
I think that will be pretty easy.
</p>

<p>
Hmmm, no, reading the docs, looks like the '%bxy' pattern only works with
single-character delimiters. No bigs, I can write a quick pre-processing function
to do it.
</p>

<p>
Finished lua scripts to generate C code for glfw module, it works! Next: gl lib
wrappers.
</p>

<p>
I spoke too soon, glfw.getWindowParam(GLFW_OPENED) isn't working correctly.
</p>

<p>
I'll need to create a simple C caller app to call the 'test.lua' program,
allowing me to step through with gdb.
</p>

<p>
Got the test app built, did some stepping and figured out the bug: I was pushing
positive index values instead of negative ones. Fixed that, now all else I
need is to reverse the order of the negative indexes in 'gen_wrappers.lua'
</p>

<p>
On the gl wrapper, think I will only wrap a selected subset for now. Still
would be nice to do it by parsing header file though. I'll just define
the subset as a list and scan and parse the gl.h header file to do them.
Main thing will be to parse each function declaration, which can be
be either single or multiline:
</p>
<pre>
...
GLAPI void GLAPIENTRY glColor3ui( GLuint red, GLuint green, GLuint blue );
GLAPI void GLAPIENTRY glColor3us( GLushort red, GLushort green, GLushort blue );

GLAPI void GLAPIENTRY glColor4b( GLbyte red, GLbyte green,
                                   GLbyte blue, GLbyte alpha );
GLAPI void GLAPIENTRY glColor4d( GLdouble red, GLdouble green,
                                   GLdouble blue, GLdouble alpha );
...
</pre>

<h2>2011-10-03</h2>

<p>
Monday, up early, continuing work on gen wrapper lua scripts for gl lib. The
existing scripts for glfw make it easier.
</p>

<p>
Finished initial implementation, added to glfw/test.lua, we have a green triangle!
</p>

<h2>2011-10-04</h2>

<p>
Great night's sleep, but not as much time left - let's go. Will start on the higher-lever
lua gamelib module which provides user-friendly functions around the gl and glfw libs.
</p>

<p>
Got the initial implementation of the gamelib.lua module working, along with the
first demo app 'pong.lua'. It always seems to take me longer than I anticipated,
but it's working. Next: add window dim query, fps, font, key input.
</p>

<p>
Home after a long day, time for a little proggin before dinner. Starting on 
a lua wrapper for the existing sys.c module (gamelib needs sys_double_time())
The question is, do I write the wrapper by hand or write another lua 
script to generate it? I'm leaning towards the script approach - the better
I get at auto-generating wrappers for C code, the easier it will be to wrap
additional modules, which I'll definitely need to do.
</p>

<p>
One issue that's cropping up is how to best organize all the lua and C code
that I'm creating. Here are some existing categories:
</p>
<ul>
<li>C code
  <ul>

So I want to create a lua parser module to generalize and centralize the wrapper-generation code.
Where to put it? A number of the modules currently under test/lua should be moved out of test,
but where? Under 'CATEGORY/lua' subdirs? Or under 'lua/CATEGORY' subdir? I'm going to go
with 'CATEGORY/lua', so will create a parse subdir and put them there. Or maybe just put
the lua files directly under the 'CATEGORY' dir? How do other people do it? For now, think
I'll just put everything under each category (both C and lua) unless there is a reason
to organize more specifically.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-05</h2>

<p>
Up good and early today, but the time is flying. Started on the more generalized lua scripts
to generate wrappers from C header files. It's going well, but I need to think of a way
to specify various options during the processing. I changed the scripts to read from stdin,
maybe I'll also just start doing command-line processing of options. Hmm, problem with that
though is that it's awkward to directly specify a list of selected functions for parsing,
well duh, just allow reading from file then.
</p>

<p>
After work, power very low. I will write my own getopt.lua, I've already done similar
in python.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-06</h2>

<p>
Thursday, wow. Up at the regular time, time for some regular coding. Implementing my
own getopt in lua. The implementation was easy, but does it work?
</p>

<p>
Cool, I believe it does work.
</p>

<p>
Done with work, in car before drive home, will work a little to get my mind going
on finishing this wrapper script, must get it done.
</p>

<p>
Got 'ret_decl, func_name, params' parsed ok with regex.
</p>

<p>
Will add special lua code to convert lua tables to C structs
</p>

<p>
Using the debug a little, I need to add support for printing globals.
</p>

<p>
Also need to fix tflua refs in tf_debug.lua:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; q
lua: ../test/lua/tf_debug.lua:338: attempt to index global 'tflua' (a nil value)

<p>
Fixed, just replaced the tflua.quit() with os.exit()
</p>

<p>
sel_funcs is working
</p>

<h2>2011-10-07</h2>

<p>
Friday, Hallelujah. Solid night's sleep, but not a whole lot of time left this
morning, gotta get this wrapper done! Need to implement 'remove-prefix' option.
</p>

<p>
Did it, it works. Next, continue adding rest of code generation.
</p>

<p>
Tried to use the debugger again, it's still got issues...grr
The stack doesn't appear correct when I break in gen_func_wrapper().
Oh well, there's always printf.
</p>

<p>
Ok, finally got the code for the first function generated. Now, just need
to output to file, and add the register list output and we'll be done for now.
But time to go to work!
</p>

<h2>2011-10-08</h2>

<p>
Sweet Saturday morning. Next up: change the gen_wrappers script to output
file names with 'lua_XXX_' prefix where XXX is the base part of the input
header file.
</p>

<p>
Output of lua_xxx_func_def.c and lua_xxx_func_reg.c is working, now just
need to add generation of the main c file that includes them.
</p>

<p>
No, will just manually generate that one, I've spent enough time
on the wrapper scripts for the time being.
</p>

<p>
Built the lib, tested pong.lua, fps works!

<h2>2011-10-09</h2>

<p>
Tried to do what was supposed to be a quick port to win32 yesterday (not
in the sharpest frame of mind) and ran into problems loading glfwCloseWindow()
from the glfw.dll that I fixed by renaming the lua wrapper dll to something
different. Although I'm not 100% sure this was necessary, I will stick with
this change for now.
</p>

<p>
Did it, what next? Need to get the fontlib wrapped.
</p>

<p>
First, been working on getting the gl lib wrappers to be generated by the parse
wrapper scripts. Now: improving the debugger by getting it to print globals as
well as locals.
</p>

<p>
Added printing of globals, works, which is great, but I still don't see
how to access and print 'local' variables of a module.
</p>

<p>
Looks like I'll have to do a little more review of lua execution environments,
which is all to the good.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-10</h2>

<p>
Monday morning, up early, reading about chunks. A chunk is treated as the body
of an anonymous function. So the locals declared in any file should be accessible
from the debug library. Reading chapter 6, such local variables of a file
are also upvalues for functions defined in the file.
</p>

<p>
No, after doing some tests, I see that such 'file' locals are only upvalues for
a function if it references them in the function.
</p>

<p>
Added printing of upvalues, but there is a level off-by-1 hack that I had to
do but don't understand why. Little by little though, the debugger gets better
and helped me identify another bug.
</p>

<p>
I need to come up with a 'best-way' of identifying the target stack level
once and for all.
</p>

<p>
After work, back to working on gen_wrappers, need to trim space after ctype
</p>

<p>
:[ still a problem printing vars in the debugger.
</p>

<pre>
--- lua debug console version 0.1
&gt; o

local 0010: name: [param], val: [table: 0x12a5d0]
&gt; p param
invalid expression: param
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
This is the source of my debugger woes:
<p>
<pre>
  if cur_level then
    M.target_offset = bot_level - (cur_level + 2)  -- getinfo() stack level of target function, relative to bottom level (2 levels above debug_consol())
  else
    M.target_offset = nil
  end
</pre>

<p>
This level was defined in the context of hitting a breakpoint in 'check_breakpoints()' but
now I'm calling the debug_console() directly in the target code and the target level is
off by one. I need to add a check that looks at the number of debugger functions on the
stack to determine the true target level.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-11</h2>

<p>
Last night I realized some changes that should be done to the debugger to improve it.
First: all functions that need to reference a target level should receive a relative
level parameter and calculate the actual level inside the function. This will fix the
current behavior where the level breaks if the function call level changes.
</p>

<p>
Second, determine the target level programmatically instead of using a fixed value,
so it's correct no matter whether debug_console() is called directly from the
target or from check_breakpoint().
</p>

<p>
Created count_up_to_src_level() and target_level() functions, that is going to help.
</p>

<p>
Ok, looks like it's working. Next, I would really like to implemnt 'next' and 'step'
control. But will checkin code first. Wait, should also test breakpoint.
</p>

<p>
Tested it, looks like still correct location, hallelujah.
</p>

<p>
Next thing to work on: add script to replace defines in header files, to fix stuff
like this:
</p>
<pre>
beg gfw: decl: [GLAPI void GLAPIENTRY glClearIndex( GLfloat c );]
  ret_decl: [GLAPI void GLAPIENTRY], func_name: [glClearIndex], params_decl: [ GLfloat c ]
  param  1: [GLfloat] [c], luatype: [number]
  lua: ../parse/gen_wrappers.lua:347: lua_ret_type is nil for c_ret_type: [GLAPI void GLAPIENTRY]
</pre>

<p>
Created script, it works (but not robustly, need to update to support full token-scanning and
substitution as opposed to simple gsub).
</p>

<p>
parse/gen_wrappers.lua script is finally now parsing the whole gl header file. Now just
have to finish implementation of arg, func call and return emission.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-12</h2>

<p>
Tuesday morning, slept in, maybe an hour of programming time left. Will start working on
using the parse/gen_wrappers.lua script to generate wrappers for glfw.
</p>

<p>
Need to work on the declaration parsing code, it's currently getting tripped up by a
nested ; in a struct declaration. At some point, I'll probably need to implement a 
real parser, but for now, would just like to get on with the game dev stuff!!
</p>

<p>
After work, at Bernices, inspired by attending a political rally at Caras Park 
(Occupy Missoula). Got to get moving on the game. Driving this mornign, I thought
that a full parse won't be needed right now. Will just create a few new scripts
to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>join continued lines
<li>remove preproc blocks (#ifXXX ... #endif)
<li>remove blank lines
<li>read the resulting file char-by-char and parse declarations by ignoring
    everything in the outermost { } delimiters.
</ul>

<p>
Got it working.
</p>

<p>
At home, got parse/filter_ifdefs.lua script working. 
</p>

<p>
Next: start on 'strip_non_func_decls.lua'.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-13</h2>

<p>
Up at 7, Thursday, getting to work. Last night, I realized that parsing the declarations
to only yield function declarations works best when called from within the gen_wrappers
script, as it will work like an iterator.
</p>

<p>
glfw wrapping is now working with the parse scripts.
</p>

<p>
Next: wrap sys then move on to the font module.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-14</h2>

<p>
Sweet Friday, up at 6, think I'll start on wrapping the tfont module. Nope, the sys module
is broken, need to fix that first. Fixed. And I think I'll get the keyboard stuff
in glfw working first too.
</p>

<p>
The getKey() function works already. Next, I added code to report skipped functions in
parse/genWrapper and currently it skips 35 funcs in glfw. Think I'll start adding support
to return values via param int pointers so functions like glfwGetWindowSize() will
can be wrapped. This will require an additional kind of input to the wrapper script
to declare certain params as return params. Either that, or I could just _assume_
that any int* param is a return param. But that might make an ass out of u and me.
</p>

<p>
Gotta have some kind of declaration, hiding stuff, implicit and unexpected behavior in 
sw is generally bad bad.
</p>

<p>
I suspect over time there will be more qualifications and specifications needed
for wrapping, but for now, will just create another input file type 'RET_PARAMS'
with a format like:
</p>
<pre>
return {
  [func_name,param_id]=true,
}
</pre>

<p>
While I'm at it, I'm generalizing the use of lua files for parse/gen_wrapper.lua params.
</p>

<p>
Updated gen header and gen wrappers for gl, added verbose flag to parse.gen_wrappers.luaparse. 
So much little workies.
</p>

<p>
Next: finish implementing parse/gen_wrappers --ret-params option.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-15</h2>

<p>
Ah, the weekend. Quiet early Saturday morning with coffee and rain outside. Starting on
the --ret-params option.
</p>

<p>
Finished implementation, looks like it works. Well, almost. After compiling, I realize
another little piece of info is needed, the local declaration of 'int *' ret params
needs to be 'int'. Will probably have to supplement the info in the ret_params map.
</p>

<p>
Maybe for now, will just take the simple approach approach and assume a '*' needs
to be stripped off of the ctype return param.
</p>

<p>
Did it, it worked.
</p>

<p>
Testing getWindowSize() in pong.lua, using the debugger again (moved out of test/lua
to debugger), and another debugger problem:
</p>
<pre>
mhackslab:gamelib $ lua pong.lua 
--- lua debug console version 0.1
level  5: src: [=[C]]
level  4: src: [@pong.lua]
level  3: src: [@./gamelib.lua]

level -2: src: [=(tail call)]
level -3: src: [=(tail call)]
level -4: src: [=(tail call)]
level -5: src: [=(tail call)]
...
</pre>

<p>
Had to fix some problems that resulted from renaming the debugger module.
</p>

<p>
Fixed that, but more debugger debug fun:
</p>
<pre>
mhackslab:gamelib $ lua pong.lua 
--- lua debug console version 0.1
 1 [./gamelib.lua:79] (win_height)
 &gt; print width
 lua: ../debugger/debugger.lua:314: assign to undeclared variable 'func_name'

./gamelib.lua:79: in function 'win_height'
pong.lua:15: in main chunk
[C]: ?
mhackslab:gamelib $ 
</pre>

<p>
Cool, that one was a catch of a missing local declaration after I started
requiring strict.
</p>

<p>
Ok, debugger got me to the point of needing to step through the wrapper
code, time to crank up the ole' gdb. I'll need to use a C app with lua
calls for that, think I've already made one before, will adapt it.
</p>

<p>
Hah, went through the whole trouble of creating a debug app that loads lua_glfw.o
(which was working) and discovered the cause of the bug before I even got the chance
to run gdb. I was retrieving the window width and height before the window had
been created, duh.
</p>

<p>
Ok, wrapped functions with return parameters (at least lua_glfw.getWindowSize()) are
working.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-16</h2>

<p>
A little too much funs last night, my brain is dragging. This morning I started
creating the 'hello world' demo for the gamelib framework and this motivated
me to start on the documentation as well. I'm going to follow many of the vim
conventions for documentation. I plan on leveraging capabilities of the vim editor 
itself for navigating and displaying the docs (links, syntax coloring). The
destination files will be simple text format, with simple markup vim conventions.
</p>

<p>
A need for syntax coloring is finally driving me to learn how syntax coloring
works in vim and how to create my own syntax coloring scripts. 
</p>

<p>
Today is probably a good day to do the mundane and sometimes tedious work of
creating documentation, as opposed to coding and debugging.
</p>

<p>
Ha, all I really needed to do for now is 'se ft=help'. I knew that leveraging
vim functionality would give quick payoffs.
</p>

<p>
Demo function works, now must start on the wrapper for tfont module.
</p>

<p>
Took a big break today because I wasn't feeling well, and also I'm lazy. Now
I need to add support for the first 'const char*' param type to parse/gen_wrappers,
should be very straightforward.
</p>

<p>
Built the lua_tfont module, trying to get it to work with the hello.lua demo,
I need to link in png-loading support.
</p>

<p>
pws. sunlight-powered hydrolysis, using tea.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-19</h2>

<p>
Took a break over the last couple of days reading about shared libraries to deal with
some linking and loading problems involving the additional shared libraries that I
created for the demo app.
</p>

<p>
Often when I run in to these kinds of problems I start reading the fundamentals of
linking and loading, hoping to acquire a deep and detailed understanding of what's
really going on. Generally after a little time and progress, I return to just trying
to get it to work. That's where I'm at right now. I just created a shared lib
for the util object files, using the '-dynamiclib -undefined dynamic_lookup' flags.
I think added this util.so file to the end of the link line for the lua_sys.so
shared lib. Now I'll try copying both to the gamelib directory and see what happens.
</p>

<p>
Here is the current error I'm getting:
</p>
<pre>
mhackslab:gamelib $ lua pong.lua
lua: error loading module 'lua_sys' from file './lua_sys.so':
dlopen(./lua_sys.so, 2): Symbol not found: _png_create_info_struct

./gamelib.lua:11: in main chunk
[C]: in function 'require'
pong.lua:5: in main chunk
[C]: ?
mhackslab:gamelib $ 
</pre>

<p>
I'm fairly confident that the _png_create_info_struct symbol is in the util.so
lib so need to figure out why it isn't being found.
</p>

<p>
nm on util.so shows:
</p>
<pre>
         U _png_create_info_struct
</pre>

<p>
So, just need to link either a static or shared lib for png.
</p>

<p>
Hmm, this is weird, the only reference to libpng in my Makefiles is in util/Makefile.osx
and it's not even referenced. Did it used to be?
</p>

<p>
Weird, git history doesn't appear to show any use of it.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to go back to the previous working config of pong.lua to see how the png lib
gets loaded. Learned to retrieve prev version of a file using 'git show':
</p>
<pre>
mhackslab:util $ git show HEAD^:./Makefile.osx &gt; Makefile-old.osx
</pre>

<p>
Got it running again, now to search for _png_create_info_struct.
</p>

<p>
Not there, so as usual, there is more going on than meets the eye. Must be loading
it from a system path.
</p>

<p>
But wait dumbkopf, no actual use is made of png in the old version of the gamelib
app. It's only when you created the 'util.so' that the reference was needed.
</p>

<p>
More clarity. For some reason I thought that png-loading capability was present
in glfw and so thought maybe it was referencing libpng there somehow but after
looking at nm output for libglfw.dylib and not finding it and then carefully
reading the docs, I discover that it only supports tga format!
</p>

<p>
So at this point my plan is to link libpng.a statically with the util.so shared
lib and intend that this is going to fix the current loading problems.
</p>

<p>
Did it, it worked!
</p>

<p>
I also realize I can avoid the table-renaming of 'lua_sys' and 'lua_glfw' in
lua because the actual shared lib file can be 'lua_glfw.so' while the registered
name in lua can be 'glfw'. That will keep things cleaner.
</p>

<p>
Got lua_tfont.so loaded in demo/hello.lua, now just need to add font-drawing call
and resource file.
</p>

<p>
Almost working!

<p>
Hack hack hack.
Victory!
We have text displayed in demo/hello.lua
</p>

<p>
Even better, I am much more comfortable now with understanding and creating
the lua wrapper and C shared libraries that are needed.
</p>

<p>
Next:
</p>
<ul>
<li>fix cwd
<li>more docs, esp for font
<li>more demos
<li>make pong have paddles, physics
<li>finish edit module

After work, a little more proggin. Investigating the cwd which requires
another sys and wrapper function, with a new return type, const char*.

attempt to fix the above problem.

Did some googling, I need to read up on otool I think.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-20</h2>

<p>
Sweet Friday again. Readin a very nice book: "Mac OSX Internals - Complete".
Playing with my otool. This might be a problem:
</p>

<p>
The cyclical reference to itself doesn't look right.

Looking through the Makefiles, I wonder if the problem is because I'm statically linking glfw

<p>
So what is the @executable_path? Probably something dumb like './appName?.app/Contents/MacOS/'
</p>

<p>
I vaguely remember using some other mac tool to specify the @executable_path for some
cross-platform desktop work I did last year. Not sure if that is really the problem though,
will keep reading.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-25</h2>

<p>
Spending some time on other stuff, like gamepad input device, so progress is slow. Read
some more this morning about mac osx shared libs and loading in Mac OSX internals book. Will
read a little more about otool now.
</p>

<p>
Well, I just fixed the pwd.lua problem by splitting out the sys.o code from the problematic
messy grab-bag of util.so and just built a sys.so. I'll just keep doing that with all
the other modules in the util dir and see if that makes things go more smoothly.
</p>

<p>
Still a problem here though:

<p>
Ok, rebuilt libglfw.dylib in the glfw dir after removing the 'install_name' DYLIBFLAG, fixed up
lua module name of glfw in glfw/lua_glfw_const_def.c and now pong demo runs again!
</p>

<p>
Now, back to the demos, need to create an img.so for tfont.so
</p>

<h2>2011-10-26</h2>

<p>
Rebuilt tfont lib to get rid of dependency on win.o, it gets the win height from gl viewport
call. 'hello.lua' demo works now. Things are looking good. Next, I want to complete the
cross-platform build process and improve the docs and maybe make the gamelib available
on a web page.
</p>

<p>
First thing, I will add subdirs for the glfw, libpng and zlib dependencies and makefiles 
to build them.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-27</h2>

<p>
Yesterday, got the zlb build working, now starting on glfw.
</p>

<p>
Built that no problem, next doing libpng, gah, it's very weird. Compiling with libtool? wtf?
</p>
<pre>

</pre>

<p>
This is the relevant link line, will work back from there:
</p>
<pre>
libtool: link: gcc -dynamiclib  -o .libs/libpng.3.dylib  .libs/libpng_la-png.o .libs/libpng_la-pngset.o .libs/libpng_la-pngget.o .libs/libpng_la-pngrutil.o .libs/libpng_la-pngtrans.o .libs/libpng_la-pngwutil.o .libs/libpng_la-pngread.o .libs/libpng_la-pngrio.o .libs/libpng_la-pngwio.o .libs/libpng_la-pngwrite.o .libs/libpng_la-pngrtran.o .libs/libpng_la-pngwtran.o .libs/libpng_la-pngmem.o .libs/libpng_la-pngerror.o .libs/libpng_la-pngpread.o   -lz    -install_name  /Users/williamknight/swtools/graphics/libpng/lib/libpng.3.dylib -compatibility_version 45 -current_version 45.0 -Wl,-single_module
</pre>

<p>
There are 2 different lines that create first obj file above, 'libpng_la-png.o':
</p>
<pre>
libtool: compile:  gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG -g -O2 -MT libpng_la-png.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/libpng_la-png.Tpo -c png.c  -fno-common -DPIC -o .libs/libpng_la-png.o

</pre>

<p>
Ah, no, only the first one is used in creating the dylib, the second one is used in creating the static lib.
</p>

<p>
Now I just need to understand the purpose of '-MT libpng_la-png.lo'. Docs say '-MT' means 'add unquoted target',
wtf does that mean? Is it just for dependencies? I don't care about that.
</p>

<pre>
mhackslab:libpng-1.2.41 $ cat libpng_la-png.lo 
# libpng_la-png.lo - a libtool object file
# Generated by ltmain.sh (GNU libtool) 2.2.6b

<p>
I will just try building without these kind of files for now, I think they are just used for
platform-independent building of shared libs and I will be explicitly creating 'Makefile', 'Makefile.osx'
and 'Makefile.ming' files to handle that instead.
</p>

<p>
Ok, built libpng, got it all working, moved stuff to demo dir. It's coming together, need to
implement recursive make and move lua into project tree so everything will be fully self-contained
(except for opengl).
</p>

<p>
Home after a long day, just a few minutes before dinner, starting on recursive makes.
</p>

<p>
Finished recursive make after dinner, it works. Next, just need to move lua in there
then I'll start on the mingw makefiles.
</p>

<p>
Moved in lua, tomorrow will start on mingw.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-28</h2>

<p>
Sweet Friday, working on Windows XP on my old thinkpad, but with nice big external
flat screen monitor and keyboard, it's almost as good as working on linux or my macbook
now, which use same monitor and keyboard. Anyhow, I'm ready to start generating mingw
makefiles from the Makefile.osx files.
</p>

<p>
Bleh, had to log out and into admin just to turn off the damn speaker beep, now to work.
</p>

<p>
Weird, there are some strange diffs with the version of lua I just built on win xp/mingw,
might be because of the luaconf.h file I used from Mac OSX, here is what it's doing:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; print(math.huge)
1.#INF
&gt; buf=io.read(math.huge)
&gt; print(#buf)
0
</pre>

<p>
Hmm, does the same thing with the pre-built version of lua too, well guess that's good.
I'll just deal.
</p>

<h2>2011-10-29</h2>

<p>
Saturday morning. Wasn't able to check in the work I did yesterday on this thinkpad
because I had cloned the git repository on my macbook, which wasn't a bare repository.
This morning, I did a clone instead from the missoulagamedev repository on modwest.
Next, I'll do a test push to make sure I can upload the work.
</p>

<p>
Good, worked liked I expected. On with it.
</p>

<p>
Hmm, lua string.gsub() is _NOT_ working at all how I expected it to:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; print(repl)
bf
&gt; print(buf)
        $(CC) -o $@ -dynamiclib -undefined dynamic_lookup $&lt; -framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL

&gt; pat='-dynamiclib -u'
&gt; s = string.gsub(buf,pat,repl)
&gt; print(s)
        $(CC) -o $@ -dynamiclib -undefined dynamic_lookup $&lt; -framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL

&gt; pat='-dynamiclib -'
&gt; s = string.gsub(buf,pat,repl)
&gt; print(s)
        $(CC) -o $@ bf -undefined dynamic_lookup $&lt; -framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL

&gt;
</pre>

<p>
It's not specific to gsub, it's something with the lua pattern matching:
</p>
<pre>
&gt; pat='-dynamiclib -'
&gt; n = string.find(buf, pat)
&gt; print(n)
14
&gt; pat='-dynamiclib -u'
&gt; n = string.find(buf, pat)
&gt; print(n)
nil
&gt; print(buf)
        $(CC) -o $@ -dynamiclib -undefined dynamic_lookup $&lt; -framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL

&gt;
</pre>

<p>
First thing I will do is test this on mac to see if there's more weirdness
with lua on mingw.
</p>

<p>
Tried it, then reviewed lua patterns, duh, I forgot that '-' is magic!
</p>

<h2>2011-10-30</h2>

<p>
Ran in to a linking problem yesterday building glfw:
</p>
<pre>
C:\Documents and Settings\strangecell\proj\vblend\glfw\libglfw&gt;make -f Makefile.mingw
dllwrap --dllname libglfw.dll --def glfwdll_mgw1.def enable_dll.o fullscreen_dll.o glext_dll.o image_dll.o init_dll.o

 win32_window_dll.o:win32_window.c:(.text+0x19ab): undefined reference to `_glfwRefreshContextParams'
 collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
 C:\home\willkn\swtools\mingw\bin\dllwrap.exe: C:\home\willkn\swtools\mingw\bin\gcc exited with status 1
 make: *** [libglfw.dll] Error 1

 C:\Documents and Settings\strangecell\proj\vblend\glfw\libglfw&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Before investigating, need to cleanup to free some disk space.
</p>

<p>
Did that, next, built ref version of glfw on mingw, no probs. I'm thinking
my version fails because I removed the static lib build, comparing the
two different make outputs.
</p>

<p>
Comparing them, I now think there must be something different in the
includes for compiling win32_window.c, because the ref build doesn't
give the warning about glfwRefreshContextParams.
</p>

<p>
Next, will probably compare preprocessed files of that c file.
</p>

<p>
Ok, believe that I tracked it down, the diff is in glfw/lib/internal.h,
the glfw-2.7.2 version on my xp thinkpad has the missing _glfwRefreshContextParams()
declaration and the reason is because the version of glfw on my macbook
is different! It's glfw-2.7! DUH!!
</p>

So next, will build again on macbook with new version, test, checkin changes
and later resume work on win32.
</p>

<h2>2011-11-01</h2>

<p>
Back on macbook, getting libglfw to build here. Still re-organizing the the
cocoa, win32 and x11 files.
</p>

<p>
Built, tested, pong works. Back to win32.
</p>

<p>
Got glfw-2.7.2 files syncd up, it builds. Moving on to next Makefile.
</p>

<p>
Working on building util, now I'm back to real porting issues, timespec
isn't declared.
</p>

<p>
Ah, duh, that's the later, more precise struct, I only need timeval
for now, will just handle with ifdefs.
</p>

<p>
Did it, it works. On to the next one, zlib, need to get the multi-platform
version off of macbook, so back to checkin and switch-over and then must
go to work.
