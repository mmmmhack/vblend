Ape (Annotated Program Execution) Documentation

== Overview ==

TODO

== Steps File ==

If the WriteSteps() function is called, it will create a file that records
the current program execution sequence and associated annotations. This
'steps' file is in vim script format and defines a list that contains
step data.

Data for each step consists of:
	* source filename for program step
	* source line number for program step
	* narrative text for program step
	* [continue-execution type: {'step', 'next'}]	  (later, will add 'breakpoint' types)

== Mappings ==

f1	show this help
f8  'step' the program in gdb if at end, else step['continue'] the program in gdb
f9  'next' the program in gdb if at end, else step['continue'] the program in gdb

== Development Mappings ==

f5	call Init()
f6  call CloseWindows()
